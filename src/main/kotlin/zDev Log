    King safety checklist:
        - king cant move into enemy lanes, nor pawns
        - king cant "hide" behind itself when in check (pieces must see through the king)
        - kings must also cast rays to their next square
        - pieces cant move out of a pin (if their attempted move vector is not on the same axis of the pin )
        - king cant castle out of check
        - king cant castle through check (same ray logic as king hiding)
        - castling moves both the king and rook



   todo:
        - Allow Base.Board class's essential operations to update its bitBoards
